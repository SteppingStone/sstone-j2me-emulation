sstone-j2me-emulation -- Stepping Stone J2ME Emulator Shim
===================================================================

This library is used as a shim to allow sstone-j2me to be launched from
sstone-dat using microemulator.

This project uses an ant build. You must have the Sun WTK 2.5.2 and proguard (I
used v4.6) installed to build.

To get help on the ant targets, run::

    ant help
